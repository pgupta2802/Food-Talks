Food Talks

We have built a food talk app. Here users can create their accounts using the register portal and that information is saved. Using login users can login into their accounts and create posts. Posts include adding pictures, reviews of their restaurants, location. These posts are also saved and can be viewed by other users. Users can also comment on other posts. Users have a bio on their profile which can be changed to anything and any amount of times. Users can also delete their posts. It's an interactive app focused for university students to identify the best and affordable food eating spots on campus and using the comment options interact as well. Users also have the option to filter the data (projection) and search for restaurants that are given a good rating.



Changes made to the original Schema - 
Added Major attribute in User profile to tailorize the results by which people can connect easily with the same major.
Didn’t implement  friends , likes , messages and  videos from the relational schema due to compatibility issues.
Scalability issues for videos didn’t allow it to implement it . It requires a string of photos in a continuous execution and saving those many photos for every user is not a feasible option. Users already have the option to comment so having a messaging feature seems redundant in this case as this platform is for allowing users to openly share their views. Having friends on this app also violates the openness and review system we want to implement, here the basic idea is that people can be honest and open to everyone about their experience and not just to friends.
